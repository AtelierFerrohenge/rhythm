# rhythm

Next Priorities:
	Add in a modifiable active period for key presses and integrate the timer into the class itself instead of as a child Node
	Start designing simple debug visuals
		or
	Figure out how to implement polling windows
		Perhaps array for each "lane" and store frame countdown set by timer?
