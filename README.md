# rhythm

Next Priorities:
	Start designing simple debug visuals
	Make function call triggers more flexible, such as linked to or simultaneous with visuals, rather than tied to scene tree timers

Upcoming:
	Figure out how to implement polling windows - May be completed by ad hoc timer signals already, review later
		Perhaps array for each "lane" and store frame countdown set by timer?
	Figure out what to do with the global beat timer
